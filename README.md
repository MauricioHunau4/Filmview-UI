# Filmview

## The code can be cloned

If you want to try it, clone the project and write "npm i" or "yarn add"

Filmview is a web page where you can write reviews of any movie you like, rating them and reading others user's reviews. First you need to do an account by going to sign up where they are going to ask you a username and a password to be able to write a review, then ou will be redirected to the main page where all the reviews will be displa to read.

This is only a personal project, I made it with React for the frontend and Node.js and PostrgeSQL, MySQL for the backend and the server. 
I will guide you with photos through the app. 
This is the main page where all the reviews will be :

Then you proceed to do an account by clicking the sign up link and you will be here (because this is a personal project I will not be asking for personal information):

![Filmview-login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69403501/166060577-1eb82521-cb79-4308-a5c3-242bd9a6fd20.png)

Now you are able to do a review with the button "Make a review" in the right corner off the bar, and you will be drag to this page (In the future will be live and with an API with real movies):

Then when you click "Share" your review will be in the main page where everybody can see it.

But wait, don't you like what you wrote? That's not a problem you can deleted it whenewer you want (only if you wrote it, of course), with this button:

![filmview_review_postpng](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69403501/171930851-eb360f81-8613-4984-8ab0-c97e170209b1.png)

Now let's say there are multiple reviews but you don't want to search page by page an especific movie, so I added a search bar where only will be found the movies that you want. But in the case no one write a review about it, it will appear an alert that says:

![filmview_alert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69403501/171931131-eb0b1262-2ba5-495c-a98a-311b6e3e7ed3.png)

Now you can search your movie, rate it and write your opinion about how did you feel when you saw it.

## Future updates:
 - A button where you can edit your reviews
 - An API where there are all the movies and the specifications of it
 - Pushing it live where everybody can make an account and share their opinions

# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
